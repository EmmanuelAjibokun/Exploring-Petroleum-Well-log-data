    "#### Supervised learning: \n",
    "    this is the process of learning in which machines or algorithms are trained with labelled datasets, which act as the supervisor, teaching the machine to predict the output currectly. In supervised learning process, input data and correct output data are applied to the algorithm to learn function `f` which maps the input variable `X` with output variable `Y` based on training examples. `Y` is f(x) where `y` is the predicted output, `x` is the applied input. \n",

    "#### types of supervised learning\n",
    "1. classification problems: the following are examples\n",
    "    decision tree, randomforest, bayes classifier, support vector machine.\n",
    "2. Regression task: some algorithms for this are:\n",
    "    linear regression, non linear regression, polynomial regression, randomforest, support forest, decision tree regression, lasso regression.\n",

    "##### Real life classification task\n",
    "    1. classification of an area into natural disaster categories, such as flood susceptability\n",
